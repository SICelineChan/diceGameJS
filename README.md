# diceGameJS
This is one of the boss challenge level exercises from the Udemy fullstack bootcamp course.
I've signed up to do this course almost the same time when I started my fullstack course with Hamburg Coding School. Since I have some time to spare, I want to take those challenges with minimum hints. This exercise is about HTML DOM and how to write JS codes to manipulate what's written in the HTML file.
