# diceGameJS
This is one of the boss challenge level exercises from the Udemy fullstack bootcamp course from Dr Angela Yu.
The base file contains images, html and css.
The only thing that I have to do is to complete the external JS file which I called it dice.js instead of index.js as per her instructions.
I've signed up to do this course almost the same time when I started my fullstack course with Hamburg Coding School. Since I have some time to spare, I will "try" to take on the challenges with minimum hints. 
This exercise is about HTML DOM and how to write JS codes to manipulate what's written in the HTML file.
